                <p className="section-text">As far back as I can remember, I have had the unwavering desire to create. From the age of seven I was writing my own songs on the guitar, and by fifteen I was writing my first piano pieces. It was this desire to create that eventually led me to music college where I graduated with a degree in music composition.</p>
                <p className="section-text">After graduating, I decided that I needed a change, so I packed my bags and moved to Japan to teach English. It was in Japan that I was first introduced to the world of programming, when one of my friends showed me a language learning tool that she was working on. I was instantly captivated, amazed by the endless possibilities that programming and web design were able to offer. Since then I have been working on various different projects with a focus on Javascript, React and HTML/CSS.</p>
                {/*<p className="section-text">My arts background has given me a unique perspective on programming and web design. No matter whether it is a musical composition or a web page, all creative endeavours should be beautiful, balanced and unique.</p>*/}
                <p className="section-text">I currently live in Osaka, Japan. I am a fluent Japanese speaker having achieved the JLPT N1 grade. Scroll down to see some of the projects I have been working on.</p>
